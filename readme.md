discovering rust
----------------

config example:

``` json
[   {   "loc":"../NemerleWeb"
       ,"t":"git"
       ,"branches":["master"]
       ,"m":"master"
       ,"upstream":"upstream"
    },
    {   "loc":"../fsharp"
       ,"t":"git"
       ,"branches":["master", "heather"]
       ,"m":"master"
       ,"upstream":"upstream"
    }
]
```

currently this app should be replacement for python sync script that I use to keep git repos up to date
